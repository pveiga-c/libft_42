<h3>ft_split.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the split function, which splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.

<h3>ft_itoa.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the itoa function, which converts an integer to a string.

<h3>ft_strmapi.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the strmapi function, which applies a function to each character of a string and returns a new string.

<h3>ft_striteri.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the striteri function, which applies a function to each character of a string.

<h3>ft_putchar_fd.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the putchar_fd function, which writes a character to a file descriptor.

<h3>ft_putstr_fd.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the putstr_fd function, which writes a string to a file descriptor.

<h3>ft_putendl_fd.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the putendl_fd function, which writes a string followed by a newline to a file descriptor.

<h3>ft_putnbr_fd.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the putnbr_fd function, which writes an integer to a file descriptor.

<h3>ft_lstnew.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstnew function, which creates a new linked list node.

<h3>ft_lstadd_front.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstadd_front function, which adds a node to the beginning of a linked list.

<h3>ft_lstsize.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstsize function, which counts the number of nodes in a linked list.

<h3>ft_lstlast.c</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstlast function, which returns a pointer to the last node in a linked list.

<h3>ft_lstadd_back</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstadd_back function, which takes a pointer to the first node of the list and a pointer to the new node, and it adds the new node to the end of the list.

<h3>ft_lstdelone</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstdelone function, which deletes a node from a linked list. The function takes a pointer to the node that needs to be deleted, and it frees the memory allocated to the node.

<h3>ft_lstclear</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstclear function, which deletes all the nodes from a linked list. The function takes a pointer to the first node of the list, and it frees the memory allocated to each node in the list.

<h3>ft_lstmap</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the lstmap function, which creates a new linked list by applying a function to each node of an existing linked list. The function takes a pointer to the first node of the list and a pointer to the function that needs to be applied to each node. It returns a pointer to the first node of the new list.

<h3>ft_itoa</h3>
This file contains the implementation of the itoa function, which converts an integer to a string. The function takes an integer as input and returns a string that represents the integer.
